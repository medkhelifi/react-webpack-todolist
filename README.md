## Documentation
I started fiw moths ago a [tutorial on Medium website](https://medium.com/@medkhelifi/creating-a-react-webpack-todo-list-app-bae32ca95f46) to explain step by step how to create a WebPack React Todolist
The tutorial is not finished yet ...


## Next Step
As you can see actually the webApp have no access to real database so the next steps are:

- Persist data into a real database storage, (I started configuration with a tool called [restdb.io](https://restdb.io/) tool for creation online noSql databases).
- Add Email based authentication.
- Add all optional features
